# Chain of Density ≠ Summarization  
It’s a memory fix.

Public teaser repo. The full thing stays offline.

## What you get
- benchmark_10_turns.py → the exact cold forensic test I ran on 11 models
- results/ → screenshots of 9.5–10/10 scores (including Grok @ 200k+ tokens)
- cod_enrich_public.py → stripped-down version (gets ~3:1, good enough to prove direction)

The real 6:1 loop that hits 9.52/10 average across 11 models. That part is not here.

Run the benchmark on your own model. If it fails by turn 7 you now know why this matters.

No releases, no threads, no DMs begging for the full sauce. Just proof.
